		<p>It's the distant future, and the world has become a shadow of its former self with corruption and discontent rife throughout all levels of society...<br> But one hope still remains, humanities greatest weapon of last resort is on the brink of deployment. But it just needs a little more time before it can be used. It falls on you, to protect the Kitchen Sink until it is ready to save the world!</p>
